> In a land before us, there was only the official Computing Society.  
> They were set up with the fundamentals of pub, computing and laughs.
>
> One day these values were threatened and the committee was infiltrated, tainted and destroyed.  
> Original members were removed in the name of 'seriousness' or something.
>
> Banished from the nation of Abertay Computing Society committee,  
> but not to be defeated, a new, better, piratier, illegal(ish) society was created.  
> And hence, The Abertay Pirate Computing Society (TAPComS) was created.  
> We still retain our roots, with the one who inspired us (the dread pirate Scott Wares)  
> remaining as our mascot in logo, but their committee are now sworn enemies.
>
> Yaaaaarrrr! Yo Hoe.
>
> We are computing pirates.  
> Enemies of the state ([Abertay](https://abertay.ac.uk)).  
> No Macs/pricks/Dewars allowed.  
> All hail Glorious Supreme Leader.
> All members required to pillage swag and booty regularly.
